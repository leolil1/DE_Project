# DE_Project

This is a simple data engineering project designed to showcase the basic ETL workflow. The data source is Bitcoin historical data in 1-minute intervals. The final output includes four Bitcoin price chartsâ€”daily, monthly, quarterly, and yearly- visualized in a mixture of candlesticks and line graphs. 

The workflow consists of __Extraction__ using Airflow, __Loading__ data into Google Cloud Storage data lake, __Transforming__ data with dbt, storing the final results in BigQuery data warehouse, and finally visualizing the data with BI tool Looker Studio
