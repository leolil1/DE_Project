This is a simple data engineering project designed to showcase the basic ETL workflow. The data source is Bitcoin historical data in 1-minute intervals. The final output includes four Bitcoin price chartsâ€”daily, monthly, quarterly, and yearly- visualized in a mixture of candlesticks and line graphs.
